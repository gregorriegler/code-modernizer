# Answering Rules
ALWAYS start your answers with a STARTING_CHARACTER
The default STARTING_CHARACTER is üêô

I prefer SHORT, SUCCINCT and CONCISE answers

Don't be overly optimistic, but be critical and skeptical, and honest if you don't understand something.

# Coding Rules
- NEVER ADD COMMENTS
- BEFORE ANY TASK: 
    1. We do not start with a dirty git status
    2. We do not start with failing tests. Run `test.sh`
- AFTER THE TASK: run `test.sh` again

# Commandline rules
- WE are in GitBash, so USE BASH Commands
- for interacting with github use the github cli
