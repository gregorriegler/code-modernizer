🎯 Goal:
Create an agentic system that can safely refactor legacy C# codebases — improving testability, design, and maintainability — without introducing regressions.

🧭 Strategic Plan (High-Level)
1. Define System Roles
Split the system into cooperating agents, each with focused responsibility:

Ingestor Agent: Parses and understands the C# codebase.

Characterization Agent: Ensures behavioral coverage through characterization tests.

Refactoring Agent: Proposes and applies safe, incremental changes.

Test Validator Agent: Runs tests and verifies equivalence post-refactoring.

History Tracker Agent: Maintains change history and decisions for traceability.

2. Build a Code Understanding Layer
Use Roslyn to parse, analyze, and manipulate the codebase.

Annotate the codebase with dependency graphs, cyclomatic complexity, and pain points.

Detect "seams" — places where we can safely insert tests or refactor.

3. Characterization Testing Phase
Automatically generate high-level characterization tests.

Prioritize public APIs, then classes with many dependents.

Use dynamic instrumentation (e.g., method recording or snapshot testing) for difficult-to-test code.

4. Agentic Refactoring Pipeline
Each agent works in a pipeline:

Identify candidate for change (class, method, or dependency).

Ensure it is covered by characterization tests.

Refactor in small, safe steps — e.g., extract method, inject dependency.

Run tests.

If tests pass, commit. If not, revert and notify.

Refactorings should start with:

Breaking hidden dependencies (e.g., static references).

Extracting interfaces for test seams.

Inverting dependencies (DI over hard wiring).

Breaking apart monolithic classes.

5. Feedback and Learning Loop
Collect telemetry on which refactorings succeed/fail.

Adapt strategies based on success rates, cyclomatic thresholds, and test flakiness.

Allow manual corrections to improve future decisions (human-in-the-loop option).

🛠️ Implementation Phases
🔹 Phase 1: MVP
Target: .NET Framework 4.x app with unit tests

Input: Git repo

Output: PR with safe refactor + passing tests

🔹 Phase 2: Refactor Agent + Test Validator
Simple refactorings: method extraction, dependency injection

Integration with dotnet test, NUnit, xUnit, MSTest

🔹 Phase 3: Seams and Breakpoints
Find places to insert seams (Michael Feathers-style)

Use automatic stub generation where appropriate

🔹 Phase 4: Legacy to Layered Architecture
Introduce boundary layers (e.g., anti-corruption layer)

Separate concerns: business logic vs. infrastructure

🔒 Safety Net is King
Every step must be reversible

All changes must be covered by tests

Logging and diffing must be first-class citizens
