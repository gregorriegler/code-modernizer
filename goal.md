# Goal: Implement Edit-File Tool

## Objective
Implement a Python-based edit-file tool that allows selecting a block of lines, deleting their contents, and inserting replacement content.

## Core Functionality
The tool should enable:
- Select a range of lines in a file (e.g., lines 5-10)
- Delete the contents of those selected lines
- Insert new content in place of the deleted lines
- Save the modified file

## Requirements
- Create a Python tool that integrates with the existing ToolLibrary system
- Support line-based editing operations (select, delete, insert)
- Handle file reading and writing safely
- Provide clear error messages for invalid operations
- Follow the project's tool architecture patterns

## Implementation Details
- Tool should be discoverable by the ToolLibrary system
- Accept parameters: file_path, start_line, end_line, new_content
- Validate line ranges and file existence
- Preserve file encoding and line endings
- Include proper error handling

## Success Criteria
- Tool can select and replace content in specified line ranges
- Integrates with the modernizer.sh interface
- Provides reliable file modification functionality
- Follows project coding standards and patterns
