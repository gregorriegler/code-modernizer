# Refactoring Plan

## Identified Improvements

### edit_file_tool.py
- [ ] Long method: `execute` method is doing too many things (parsing args, validation, file operations)
- [x] Extract method for argument parsing and validation
- [x] Extract method for line range validation
- [ ] Extract method for file reading and writing operations
- [ ] Magic numbers: hardcoded split parameter (3) could be more descriptive
- [ ] Long parameter list in argument parsing (4 parts) - consider using a data class or named tuple
- [ ] Improve error message consistency - some use single quotes, some use double quotes

### edit_file_tool_test.py
- [ ] Long method: `verifyEditTool` is doing multiple things (setup, execution, verification)
- [ ] Extract method for file setup operations
- [ ] Extract method for creating verification output
- [ ] Long string formatting in line 45 and 54 - could be extracted to helper methods
- [ ] Duplicated scrubber creation pattern - could be extracted to a helper method
