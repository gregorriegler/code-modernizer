ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Automatically Generate Characterization Tests
We want an agent that:

Analyzes the legacy C# code.
Identifies public-facing behavior (methods, classes, services).
Generates tests that exercise the current behavior.
Records expected outputs (snapshots or assertions).
Runs and stores the tests to act as a behavioral safety net.
