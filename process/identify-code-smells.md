# Identify a code Smell

We always start with the test code.
Only if we don't find smells in test code we continue with the production code.

Come up with a single code smell you find in the Code.

Look for

- Long Methods
- Long Parameter Lists
- Long Classes
- Long Files
- Bad Names
- Duplicated Code
