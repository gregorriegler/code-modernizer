1. Read the `README.md` to learn something about this project.
1. Read the `goal.md`. We are working inthis file.
1. Create a new section in the bottom of `goal.md` with the headline "Scenarios"
1. Think of a couple of simple happy path scenarios. Order them by simplicity ascending and add those to the `goal.md` to the scenarios section. Each scenario you add should be a new sub-headline. This headline should end with the suffix "- DRAFT"
1. Ask yourself whether all of those scenarios you added are viable for an MVP. Maybe we can remove some of the more complex ones
1. Think of exception path scenarios, and add the most important to the list
1. Ask me to read through the scenarios and make adaptions
1. commit the changes
1. Then create a new context with the prompt "Read and follow the `process/refine-scenarios.md` instructions."
