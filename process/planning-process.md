# How to plan

We will record everything in a goal description markdown file and keep enhancing and refining it.

1. Align on a goal following the process defined in (align-on-goal.md)
1. After we have concluded on a goal, create a rough component diagram using mermaid and add that to the goal description markdown file 
1. Create a list of scenarios ordered by simplicity ascending and add those to the goal description markdown file
1. Let me read through the scenarios and make adaptions
1. After I have made adaptions, expand the first Scenario and describe a series of tiny incremental steps describing an actionable path.
