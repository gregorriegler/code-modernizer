# How to plan

We will record everything in a goal description markdown file and keep enhancing and refining it.

1. Align on a goal following the process defined in (align-on-goal.md)
1. After we have concluded on a goal, create a rough component diagram using mermaid and add that to the goal description markdown file 
1. Create a list of scenarios ordered by simplicity ascending and add those to the goal description markdown file
1. Let me read through the scenarios and make adaptions
1. Then we go on to refining (refine-scenarios.md)
