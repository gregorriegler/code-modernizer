1. Pick the first Scenario.

1. When I like them, add them back to the `goal.md`
1. Turn those examples into a testlist. A Testlist is a list of tiny incremental steps describing an actionable path. Each example becomes an item in the list. Replace the examples with the testlist in the `goal.md`. Make sure the testlist is still ordered by simplicity ascending
1. prefix all items in the testlist as tasks that we can check off
