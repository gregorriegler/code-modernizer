# Entry Point Analysis Tool Plan

This document outlines the plan for building an analysis tool that identifies optimal entry points for characterization tests in C# projects using Roslyn.

## Overview

The tool will analyze C# codebases to find the most efficient set of entry points for characterization tests. By using a call graph analysis and set cover algorithm, we can identify a minimal set of public methods that provide maximum code coverage.

## Strategy

1. Build a call graph of the entire codebase
2. Identify candidate entry points (public methods on public classes)
3. Measure reachability for each candidate method
4. Apply a greedy set cover algorithm to select the optimal entry points

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Infrastructure

- [ ] Create basic project structure in the RoslynAnalysis folder
- [ ] Set up Roslyn dependencies
- [ ] Implement command-line interface with options for:
  - Target project/solution path

### 2. Call Graph Construction

- [ ] Implement solution/project loading using Roslyn
- [ ] Create a syntax walker to identify method declarations and invocations
- [ ] Build a directed graph representation where:
  - Nodes are methods
  - Edges represent method calls

### 3. Entry Point Candidate Identification

- [ ] Implement filters to identify public methods on public classes
- [ ] Create a data structure to store candidate methods with metadata

### 4. Reachability Analysis

- [ ] Implement graph traversal algorithms to determine reachable methods from each entry point
- [ ] Create a reachability matrix/map for all candidates
- [ ] Calculate coverage metrics for each candidate:
  - Number of methods reachable
  - Percentage of codebase covered
  - Unique methods covered (not covered by other candidates)

### 5. Set Cover Algorithm Implementation

- [ ] Implement a greedy set cover algorithm that:
  - Selects the candidate with maximum additional coverage at each step
  - Continues until desired coverage threshold is reached
