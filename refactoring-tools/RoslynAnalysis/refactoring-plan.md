# Refactoring Plan for RoslynAnalysis

## Identified Improvements

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified potential improvements in the `EntryPointFinder.cs` file. The `TryCreateEntryPoint` method contains several conditional checks that might not be fully covered by tests, making them candidates for removal according to the refactoring process.

## Tasks

- [x] Verify if the null check for `methodSymbol` in `TryCreateEntryPoint` is covered by tests
- [x] Verify if the null check for `containingType` in `TryCreateEntryPoint` is covered by tests
- [x] Remove unnecessary null checks if they're not covered by tests
- [x] Examine the hardcoded `reachableMethodsCount = 1` value and determine if it can be improved
- [x] Run tests after each change to ensure they still pass
