# Refactoring Plan

## Dead Code Removal

### 1. Remove unused test helper method
- [x] Remove `CreateSolutionWithProductionAndTestProjects()` method from `EntryPointFinderTests.cs` (lines ~570-670) - this method is defined but never called by any test

## Production Code Simplification

### 2. Remove untested error handling in MSBuildWorkspaceLoader
- [x] Remove null/empty parameter validation in `LoadProjectsAsync()` method - no tests exercise these conditions
- [x] Remove file existence check in `LoadProjectsAsync()` method - no tests exercise this condition  
- [x] Remove solution null check after `OpenSolutionAsync()` - no tests exercise this condition
- [x] Remove project null check after `OpenProjectAsync()` - no tests exercise this condition

## Rationale

Following the refactoring process, we identified:
1. Dead code in tests: `CreateSolutionWithProductionAndTestProjects()` method is never used
2. Production code with untested conditional expressions: Multiple if statements in `MSBuildWorkspaceLoader.LoadProjectsAsync()` that throw exceptions are not covered by any tests

Since no tests require these error handling conditions, they can be safely removed to simplify the code while maintaining all current observable behavior (all tests continue to pass).
