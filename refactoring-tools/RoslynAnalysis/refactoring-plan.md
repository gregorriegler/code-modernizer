# Refactoring Plan for EntryPointFinder.cs

## Previous Refactoring (Completed)

### Code Smell: Duplicate Code in Test Helper Methods

The test helper methods `CreateSingleClassProject()`, `CreateProjectWithMultiplePublicMethods()`, and `CreateProjectWithMultipleClasses()` contain significant duplication in how they:
1. Create temporary directories
2. Create project files with the same content
3. Create source directories
4. Write source files

This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes the tests harder to maintain.

### Refactoring Steps

- [x] Extract common project creation logic into a reusable helper method
- [x] Extract common directory creation logic into a helper method
- [x] Extract common project file creation logic into a helper method
- [x] Refactor the existing helper methods to use the new common methods
- [x] Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring

### Completed Refactoring

The refactoring has been completed successfully. The following improvements were made:

1. Created a `CreateProjectBase` method that handles:
   - Creating a project directory
   - Creating a project file with standard content
   - Creating a source directory
   - Returning a tuple with the project path and source directory

2. Created a `CreateSourceFile` helper method that:
   - Takes a source directory, file name, and file content
   - Creates the source file
   - Returns the source file path

3. Refactored the existing helper methods to use these new common methods:
   - `CreateSingleClassProject`
   - `CreateProjectWithMultiplePublicMethods`
   - `CreateProjectWithMultipleClasses`

These changes have eliminated the duplicate code in the test helper methods, making the code more maintainable and following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Current Refactoring

### Code Smell: Lack of Abstraction in EntryPointFinder

The `EntryPointFinder` class has direct dependencies on concrete implementations like `MSBuildWorkspace`, making it difficult to test and maintain. The class is also static, which further complicates testing and dependency injection.

### Refactoring Steps

- [x] Create an interface `IWorkspaceLoader` to abstract workspace and project loading
- [x] Create a concrete implementation `MSBuildWorkspaceLoader` that implements the interface
- [x] Modify `EntryPointFinder` to use the abstraction instead of direct dependencies
- [x] Make `EntryPointFinder` a non-static class that takes the workspace loader as a dependency
- [x] Update the static constructor to initialize MSBuildLocator only when needed
- [x] Update any code that uses `EntryPointFinder` to work with the new non-static implementation
- [x] Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring

### Completed Refactoring

The refactoring has been completed successfully. The following improvements were made:

1. Created an `IWorkspaceLoader` interface to abstract workspace and project loading:
   - Defined a contract for loading projects from a project path
   - Made it easier to test and maintain the code

2. Created a `MSBuildWorkspaceLoader` implementation that:
   - Handles the initialization of MSBuildLocator
   - Implements the project loading logic
   - Performs input validation

3. Modified `EntryPointFinder` to:
   - Use the abstraction instead of direct dependencies
   - Be a non-static class that takes the workspace loader as a dependency
   - Have instance methods instead of static methods

4. Updated the Program.cs file to:
   - Create an instance of MSBuildWorkspaceLoader
   - Create an instance of EntryPointFinder with the workspace loader
   - Use the instance methods instead of static methods

5. Updated the tests to:
   - Create an instance of MSBuildWorkspaceLoader
   - Create an instance of EntryPointFinder with the workspace loader
   - Use the instance methods instead of static methods

These changes have improved the code by:
- Introducing proper abstractions
- Making the code more testable
- Improving maintainability
- Following the Dependency Inversion Principle
- Making dependencies explicit
