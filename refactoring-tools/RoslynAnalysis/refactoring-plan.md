# Refactoring Plan for EntryPointFinderTests.cs

## Code Smell: Duplicate Code in Test Helper Methods

The test helper methods `CreateSingleClassProject()`, `CreateProjectWithMultiplePublicMethods()`, and `CreateProjectWithMultipleClasses()` contain significant duplication in how they:
1. Create temporary directories
2. Create project files with the same content
3. Create source directories
4. Write source files

This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes the tests harder to maintain.

## Refactoring Steps

- [x] Extract common project creation logic into a reusable helper method
- [x] Extract common directory creation logic into a helper method
- [x] Extract common project file creation logic into a helper method
- [x] Refactor the existing helper methods to use the new common methods
- [x] Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring

## Completed Refactoring

The refactoring has been completed successfully. The following improvements were made:

1. Created a `CreateProjectBase` method that handles:
   - Creating a project directory
   - Creating a project file with standard content
   - Creating a source directory
   - Returning a tuple with the project path and source directory

2. Created a `CreateSourceFile` helper method that:
   - Takes a source directory, file name, and file content
   - Creates the source file
   - Returns the source file path

3. Refactored the existing helper methods to use these new common methods:
   - `CreateSingleClassProject`
   - `CreateProjectWithMultiplePublicMethods`
   - `CreateProjectWithMultipleClasses`

These changes have eliminated the duplicate code in the test helper methods, making the code more maintainable and following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
