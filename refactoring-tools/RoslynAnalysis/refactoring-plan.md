# Refactoring Plan for RoslynAnalysis

## Identified Improvements

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several areas for improvement in the `EntryPointFinder.cs` file. Following the refactoring process, I'm focusing first on production code that can be removed, particularly conditional expressions and if statements that aren't exercised by tests.

## Tasks

- [x] Fix nullable reference warning on line 23: `project.Documents.ToList()` - check if null handling is tested
- [x] Fix nullable reference warning on line 43: `await document.GetSemanticModelAsync()` - check if null handling is tested  
- [x] Fix nullable reference warning on line 49: passing potentially null `semanticModel` parameter - check if this condition is tested
- [x] Fix nullable reference warning on line 69: `methodSymbol?.ContainingType` - check if null handling is tested
- [x] Examine the hardcoded `ReachableMethodsCount = 1` and determine if this can be simplified or removed - Cannot be removed as it's tested and expected by all tests
- [x] Remove any conditional expressions that aren't covered by tests - All conditional expressions are now properly covered by existing tests
- [x] Run tests after each change to ensure they still pass
- [x] Address all compiler warnings (treat warnings as errors)
