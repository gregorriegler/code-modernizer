# Refactoring Plan

## Identified Improvements

### RenameSymbolMeaningfulErrorTests.cs
- [ ] Remove code duplication: Both test methods have identical console capture and assertion logic
- [ ] Extract helper method for console output capture and verification
- [ ] Remove duplicate CreateDocument method (already exists in RenameSymbolErrorHandlingTests)

### RenameSymbolErrorHandlingTests.cs  
- [x] Remove code duplication: Both test methods have identical console capture and assertion logic
- [ ] Extract shared helper method for error response testing

### Test Code Organization
- [ ] Consider merging RenameSymbolMeaningfulErrorTests.cs into RenameSymbolErrorHandlingTests.cs since they test the same functionality
- [ ] Remove duplicate test scenarios that test identical behavior
