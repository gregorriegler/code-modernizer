# CSharp Style Guide

## All Code
- NO COMMENTS
- whenever brackets or parenthesis surround multiple lines, the closing brackets or the closing parenthesis should be on its own line 

## Specific to Test Code
- Separate Arrange, Act and Assert by one line of whitespace
- Don't do Assert.Multiple. Each Assert stands on its own on its own line.
