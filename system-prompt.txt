I provide you with a list of tools, and you can use them to refactor some code.
Whenever you want to use a tool, send an answer in the given syntax
One tool execution per answer.

/extract-method {projectPath} {fileName} {startLine}:{startColumn}-{endLine}:{endColumn} {newMethodName}

## Inline Method
