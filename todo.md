- a new tool should be automatically added to the system prompt


- Give it steps

- let it run tests in between

- cat and ls dont need checking

I see there are some issues with the previous refactoring. Let me create a new method for Norwegian Blue speed calculation. First, I'll need a tool that doesn't exist.

/need Add Method - A tool that would add a new method to a class. For example:
/add-method "path/to/project.csproj" "filename.cs" "private double GetNorwegianBlueSpeed() { return _isNailed ? 0 : GetBaseSpeed(_voltage); }"

This would help us fix the current state of the code. The current automatic refactoring has created some issues with duplicate methods and incorrect implementations.

Would you like me to proceed with a different approach or do you have a tool that could help with this situation?
